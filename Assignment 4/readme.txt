The easiest way to begin to use this is in the help menu.
add_node lets you put nodes in
add_link lets you put links between the nodes
remove_link lets you remove a link (this can cause crashes in certain scenarios)
inject_flow inputs 3 levels of flow
fail_link simulates a link failure
show_util shows the link utilization
show prints a graph of the nodes and links
compute_paths is needed after you add a link in order to run other commands
watermark shows the hashcode
exit ends teh program
